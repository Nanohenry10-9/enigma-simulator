# Enigma Simulator

This webpage simulates an Enigma I machine with swappable rotors and a functional plugboard.

## Controls

* Input: keyboard A - Z
* Change rotor: CTRL + [rotor index] + [new rotor number] (ex. CTRL + 1 + 3 will change the first rotor to III)
* Modify plugboard: CTRL + [first letter] + [second letter] (ex. CTRL + H + A will swap letter H and A on the plugboard)
* Reset rotors: CTRL + SPACE

**Note:** this simulator does not support changing the reflector or setting the rotors to an initial position before crypting text.
